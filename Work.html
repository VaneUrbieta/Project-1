          <p>This freelance project was for a drywall and painting company in need of a strong brand identity. The logo design blends both services into a cohesive mark, using a vintage-inspired style paired with a textured color palette to give it character and distinction. </p>

          <h3><i>Self Care News| Emails New Letter Design</i></h3>
          <p>2024<br/>Adobe illustrator and In Design<br /></p>
          <p>I designed a series of three newsletters centered on self-care, with a focus on skincare. The project was aimed at a young, feminine audience, drawing inspiration from the clean and modern aesthetic of contemporary beauty brands. Each newsletter blended engaging content with a stylish layout to capture attention while maintaining a cohesive and approachable design.</p>
